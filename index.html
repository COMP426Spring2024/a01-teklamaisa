        <h3>  Hello and welcome to the myth and magic of PJO and its adaptations! </h3>
        <p class="intro">
            Percy Jackson and the Olympians is a 5-book (or 7 depends how you count) series written by Rick Riordan. 
            The first book <em>the Lightning Thief</em> came out in 2005. Then the *attempted* to make it into a movie in 2010.
            Emphasis here really is on "attempted". Ultimately, the films were canceled after only two. Now, in 2023/2024, there
            is a Disney+ TV show adaptation. That reignited my interest in the PJO universe, so here I will discuss books/movie/show, 
            and what I think about them/how they compare.

                    this details my experience reading the books back when I was the right age demographic, and how it
                    felt to reread them as an adult(ish).

                    this is my thoughts on the movies: what they did right (logan lerman) and what they did wrong (everything
                    else).
