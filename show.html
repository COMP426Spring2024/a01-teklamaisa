            I sincerely hope that this is a happy ending to the PJO adaptation saga
        </h3>

            I am putting my thoughts aside to be optimistic. The casting is wonderful, the show looks good,
            people are talking about it,and it got greenlit for season 2... <br>
            however, here is my ranking, because they still went off the books for some reason AND the 
            the charachters have read the books apparently, because they know exactly what's about to
            happen for half the show*
