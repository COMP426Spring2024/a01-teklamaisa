            The basics 
        </h3>
        <p class="intro">
            The Percy Jackson books were written by Rick Riordan starting in 2005.
            They follow Percy Jackson, a 12-year old who finds out that he is a 
            demigod: a child of a human and a Greek God. He goes on many adventures
            with his friends Annabeth Chase and Grover Underwood to save the world.

            My thoughts
        </h3>
        <p>
            I am no longer 13 (that's when I read the series), not even close. So I do not 
            remember everything. Also, I definitely haven't read the last two books. The first 
            two books I read in Georgian and then the other three in English. Let me tell you: 
            In any language these books are AMAZING. The plot is intense, but has funny moments, 
            and the charachters are just incredible. I recently reread the first book and it's STILL
            really fun, so if you haven't, I recommend.
